    <h3 style="margin-top: 0px;">Context</h3>
    <p>The inconfidentes movement, organized in 1788, was a consequence of the contact of Brazilian colonists with the Enlightenment ideals disseminated in Europe, ideals that inspired the independence movement in the United States.
      <br> <br>
    The Brazilian economic elite was unhappy with the large taxes that were <strong>20% of all gold produced</strong> in Brazil, these taxes would not be reinvested in the State of Brazil, instead they would go to the Portuguese Crown. When Visconde de Barbacena was appointed governor of the captaincy of Minas Gerais, he should promote the collection of taxes that were not being paid.

    <h3>Plan</h3>
    <p>So Tiradentes decides to lead a conspiracy against these unfair  taxes. The inconfidentes plan was simple, <span class="markup">assassinate</span> the governor and proclaim republicanism in the captaincy.
      <br>
    Unfortunately, the plan was not carried out, one of the members of the conspirators betrayed his friend, denouncing the plan in exchange for having his debts forgiven.</p>

  <div class="card card-3">
    <h3>The fall</h3>
    <p>Tiradentes and the other conspirators were arrested, most of the conspirators denied participation in the plan, but Tiradentes openly acknowledged his involvement
      <br>
    The sentence given to the inconfidentes was the death by hanging of ten people. But through the interference of Queen Maria I, nine of those involved were pardoned and exiled from Brazil, the only one who was not pardoned was Tiradentes.
      <br>
    Thus, Tiradentes was used as a scapegoat by the Portuguese Crown. He was hanged on the morning of <time datetime="1792-04-21">April 21<sup>st</sup>, 1792</time>, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Then, the body was quartered into four parts and scattered along the access road to Ouro Preto. <span class="markup">His head was exposed on a stake</span> placed in the town's central square. Tiradentes' condemnation was used as a show of strength by the Crown to prevent future rebellions from happening.
